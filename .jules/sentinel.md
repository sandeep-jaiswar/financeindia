## 2024-05-20 - Path Traversal in BhavArchive
**Vulnerability:** The `BhavArchive.archive_equities` function accepted raw user input for `output_path` and passed it directly to `File::create(path)` without any validation.
**Learning:** This allowed arbitrary file writes anywhere on the system (e.g. `../../etc/passwd` or `/absolute/path.zip`) by exploiting path traversal. The issue existed because the PyO3 wrapper lacked an explicit input sanitization layer before interacting with the host filesystem.
**Prevention:** Validate all file paths received from Python boundaries in Rust before usage. Reject paths containing directory traversal sequences (`..`) or absolute path indicators (`/`, `\`, `:`).
## 2024-05-24 - [Fix path traversal in zip filename]
**Vulnerability:** Path Traversal / Zip Slip. In `src/archive.rs`, user-supplied dates were directly formatted into zip filenames, which would allow a malicious user to supply path traversal characters (`/` or `\`) in the date string and overwrite files outside the intended extraction directory.
**Learning:** Directly interpolating user-controlled strings into file paths inside a zip archive without sanitization is a critical vulnerability vector.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize input by replacing OS-specific directory separators ('/' and '\') with safe characters like '_' when using them to construct internal ZIP archive filenames.
## 2024-05-25 - [SSRF in MarketStream]
**Vulnerability:** The `MarketStream::new` constructor in `src/streaming.rs` accepted any URL directly without validating its scheme or host. This allowed Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) where an attacker could stream internal endpoints or unauthorized hosts via the WebSocket client.
**Learning:** Directly passing user-supplied URLs to network clients (`tokio_tungstenite::connect_async`) without filtering allowed schemes and domains opens up SSRF vectors, even in WebSocket clients.
**Prevention:** Always validate URL schemes and implement an explicit whitelist of trusted domains for outgoing network connections.
## 2024-05-26 - Restrict reqwest redirect policy
**Vulnerability:** The reqwest::Client was using the default redirect policy which follows redirects to any domain, allowing Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and open redirect attacks. Attackers could redirect the library's initial request to an internal network address or a malicious server.
**Learning:** The default redirect behavior in popular HTTP libraries is often too permissive for secure integrations. When communicating with specific APIs (like NSE), redirect targets should be explicitly constrained to trusted domains.
**Prevention:** Always implement a custom redirect policy (reqwest::redirect::Policy::custom) that enforces a maximum redirect count and strictly validates the redirect target URL against a whitelist of trusted domains and schemes.
