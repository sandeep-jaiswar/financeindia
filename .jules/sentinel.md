## 2024-05-20 - Path Traversal in BhavArchive
**Vulnerability:** The `BhavArchive.archive_equities` function accepted raw user input for `output_path` and passed it directly to `File::create(path)` without any validation.
**Learning:** This allowed arbitrary file writes anywhere on the system (e.g. `../../etc/passwd` or `/absolute/path.zip`) by exploiting path traversal. The issue existed because the PyO3 wrapper lacked an explicit input sanitization layer before interacting with the host filesystem.
**Prevention:** Validate all file paths received from Python boundaries in Rust before usage. Reject paths containing directory traversal sequences (`..`) or absolute path indicators (`/`, `\`, `:`).
## 2024-05-24 - [Fix path traversal in zip filename]
**Vulnerability:** Path Traversal / Zip Slip. In `src/archive.rs`, user-supplied dates were directly formatted into zip filenames, which would allow a malicious user to supply path traversal characters (`/` or `\`) in the date string and overwrite files outside the intended extraction directory.
**Learning:** Directly interpolating user-controlled strings into file paths inside a zip archive without sanitization is a critical vulnerability vector.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize input by replacing OS-specific directory separators ('/' and '\') with safe characters like '_' when using them to construct internal ZIP archive filenames.
## 2024-05-25 - [SSRF in MarketStream]
**Vulnerability:** The `MarketStream::new` constructor in `src/streaming.rs` accepted any URL directly without validating its scheme or host. This allowed Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) where an attacker could stream internal endpoints or unauthorized hosts via the WebSocket client.
**Learning:** Directly passing user-supplied URLs to network clients (`tokio_tungstenite::connect_async`) without filtering allowed schemes and domains opens up SSRF vectors, even in WebSocket clients.
**Prevention:** Always validate URL schemes and implement an explicit whitelist of trusted domains for outgoing network connections.
## 2026-05-10 - [SSRF via Open Redirects in Custom HTTP Clients]
**Vulnerability:** The HTTP client configured in `build_client` used the default `reqwest` redirect policy, which blindly follows redirects to any domain up to a maximum count. This allowed for potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if an initially trusted endpoint returned an open redirect to an attacker-controlled or internal network address.
**Learning:** Default HTTP client configurations often prioritize connectivity over security. Even when the initial request target is validated and trusted, subsequent redirects are not automatically subjected to the same validation logic unless explicitly configured.
**Prevention:** Always implement a custom redirect policy (e.g., `reqwest::redirect::Policy::custom`) that explicitly validates the redirect target URL against an allowlist of trusted domains, while also manually re-implementing infinite loop protections (like a redirect count limit) since the custom policy overrides default loop protections.
